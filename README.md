Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. 
The spectrum nature of autism means that symptoms and their severity can vary widely among individuals. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial, as they can
significantly improve outcomes for children with autism by providing timely support and therapies.
Traditional methods of diagnosing autism often rely on behavioral assessments and developmental history, which can be time-consuming and require expert evaluation. 
However, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) offer promising new avenues for the early prediction and diagnosis of autism.
